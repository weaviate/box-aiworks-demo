# Finance: FY2024 Profit & Loss

## Management Discussion and Analysis
Fiscal year 2024 closed with strong top-line growth driven by continued demand in North America and improved sell-through in Europe. Direct-to-consumer channels outpaced wholesale for the third consecutive quarter as we expanded our e-commerce footprint and refined paid acquisition. Gross margin improved sequentially due to lower freight rates and a favorable product mix skewing toward higher-margin rackets and premium accessories.

Operating expenses increased as we invested in brand marketing ahead of the holiday season and continued R&D on the next-generation frame. Despite these investments, operating income expanded year-over-year and cash flow from operations remained healthy. We maintain adequate liquidity to fund working capital needs and plan to prioritize inventory optimization in the first half of 2025.

## Risks and Outlook
Key risks include foreign exchange volatility, continued freight variability, and demand softness tied to macroeconomic conditions. We will monitor inventory closely, continue diversifying suppliers, and scale our loyalty program to stabilize repeat purchase behavior. 

Our 2025 plan assumes modest revenue growth with steady gross margin and disciplined OpEx.
