# Finance: Balance Sheet

## Summary
The balance sheet reflects a healthy liquidity position with ample cash to fund operations. Inventory levels ended the year above plan due to accelerated production of the spring line; we expect normalization by the end of Q2 2025. Accounts receivable quality remains strong with aging within our target thresholds.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources
We maintain a revolving credit facility that remains undrawn at year-end. Covenants include a minimum current ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, both of which we are comfortably within. Capital expenditures in 2024 focused on tooling for new frames and IT infrastructure to support enterprise search and analytics workloads.

## Outlook
We expect to reduce inventory in the first half of 2025 and redeploy working capital toward marketing and product development. Our priorities include improving forecast accuracy and deepening relationships with key suppliers to mitigate lead-time volatility.
