# Customer Service: Cancellation & Return Policy

## Policy Overview
We want you to love your purchase. Unused items in original condition can be returned within 30 days of delivery for a full refund. Customized products—such as engraved frames or custom string jobs—are not returnable unless defective. This policy operates alongside our product warranty, which covers manufacturing defects.

## How to Start a Return
To begin, locate your order number and, if relevant, the item’s serial number. Contact support to receive a prepaid return label and instructions. Please package the item securely, including all accessories and manuals. When possible, reuse the original shipping box to reduce waste and protect the product in transit.

## Refunds and Exchanges
Refunds are issued to the original form of payment within 5–7 business days after the item passes inspection. Exchanges are processed once the carrier scans the return label or when the original item is received, depending on the value of the replacement. If you need a replacement quickly, we offer an advance exchange with a temporary authorization hold.

## Exceptions and Edge Cases
Opened but unused items may be subject to a restocking fee to cover inspection and repackaging costs. Used items cannot be returned unless a manufacturing defect is confirmed. Gifts without a receipt are eligible for store credit at the current price. If a product arrives damaged, you must notify us within 48 hours so we can file a carrier claim and prioritize a replacement.
