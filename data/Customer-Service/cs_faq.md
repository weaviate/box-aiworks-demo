## Restringing Frequency
Most players benefit from restringing every 10–15 hours of play. Heavier hitters or those using polyester strings may prefer shorter intervals to maintain control. If the ball begins to trampoline off the strings or you struggle to find depth, it’s time to restring.

## Grip Customization
Grip size can be adjusted with replacement grips or build-up sleeves. A properly fitted grip reduces wrist strain and improves stability on off-center hits. If you are between sizes, start smaller and add an overgrip to fine-tune feel.

## Shipping and Tracking
All orders include a tracking link sent by email at the time of shipment. International shipments may incur duties and taxes assessed by the destination country. If tracking stalls for more than 48 hours, contact support so we can engage the carrier.
