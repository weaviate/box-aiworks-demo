# Customer Service: ProRacquet 3000 User Guide
**Summit Sports Co. · "Gear up for every adventure."**

## Introduction
Thank you for choosing the Summit ProRacquet 3000. This racket is engineered for intermediate to advanced players who value a blend of precision, controllable power, and arm comfort. The carbon-fiber layup and tuned beam profile provide stability through contact while keeping maneuverability high for quick exchanges at the net.

## Getting Started
- Confirm grip size and string tension preferences before first use.  
- A mid-range tension around 54–56 lbs offers a balanced response for most players.  
- Higher tensions increase control at the cost of power.  
- Transitioning from a heavier frame may require 2–3 sessions to adapt timing.  
- Always install the included grommet strip correctly to protect strings and maintain warranty coverage.  

## Technique Tips
- **Groundstrokes:** Keep the hitting zone in front of your body and accelerate with a relaxed wrist.  
- **Serves:** Focus on a fluid toss and consistent contact point; the 16x19 pattern rewards high-trajectory kick serves.  
- **Net Play:** The head-light balance allows for quick reaction volleys—soft hands and short backswings.  

## Care and Maintenance
- Inspect frame monthly for hairline cracks (especially around the throat and 3/9 o’clock positions).  
- Avoid prolonged heat exposure (e.g., in a car trunk).  
- Clean with a damp cloth only; solvents or high-pressure washing may damage paint and grommets.  
- Strings lose tension over time; restring regularly to preserve feel and reduce vibration.  

## Troubleshooting
- **Arm discomfort:** Reduce string tension or use a softer multifilament string.  
- **Rattling sound:** Often caused by a loose dampener or worn grommet.  
- **Power loss:** Usually results from tension drop; restringing restores response.  

## Warranty
The ProRacquet 3000 includes a two-year limited warranty that covers manufacturing defects.  
Exclusions: misuse, extreme temperatures, or stringing above recommended tension.  
Retain proof of purchase and the serial number (stamped inside the throat) to expedite service.
