# Customer Service: ProRacquet 3000 User Guide

## Introduction
Thank you for choosing the Summit ProRacquet 3000. This racket is engineered for intermediate to advanced players who value a blend of precision, controllable power, and arm comfort. The carbon-fiber layup and tuned beam profile provide stability through contact while keeping maneuverability high for quick exchanges at the net.

## Getting Started
Before first use, confirm grip size and string tension preferences. A mid-range tension around 54–56 lbs offers a balanced response for most players, while higher tensions increase control at the cost of power. Transitioning from a heavier frame may require two to three sessions to adapt timing. Always install the included grommet strip correctly to protect strings and maintain warranty coverage.

## Technique Tips
For groundstrokes, keep the hitting zone in front of your body and accelerate with a relaxed wrist. On serves, focus on a fluid toss and consistent contact point, as the 16x19 pattern rewards high-trajectory kick serves. At the net, the head-light balance allows for quick reaction volleys that benefit from soft hands and short backswings.

## Care and Maintenance
Inspect the frame monthly for hairline cracks, especially around the throat and 3/9 o’clock positions. Avoid prolonged heat exposure, such as leaving it in a car trunk. Clean with a damp cloth only, since solvents or high-pressure washing may damage paint and grommets. Because strings lose tension over time, restring regularly to preserve feel and reduce vibration.

## Troubleshooting
If you experience arm discomfort, reduce string tension or switch to a softer multifilament string. A rattling sound is often caused by a loose dampener or worn grommet. Power loss usually results from tension drop, and restringing will restore the racket’s response.

## Warranty
The ProRacquet 3000 includes a two-year limited warranty that covers manufacturing defects.  
Exclusions: misuse, extreme temperatures, or stringing above recommended tension.  
Retain proof of purchase and the serial number (stamped inside the throat) to expedite service.
