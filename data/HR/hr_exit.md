# HR Exit & Offboarding

## Overview
This offboarding guide covers voluntary resignations and involuntary separations.  
Goals:  
- Maintain business continuity  
- Protect customer and company data  
- Treat every departing employee with respect  

The process is designed to capture critical knowledge, return assets, and provide clear guidance on benefits and final pay.

## Notice and Transition
- When an employee provides notice, the manager and HR collaborate on a transition plan.  
- The plan should list open projects, the current state of each, and who will assume ownership.  
- A short written handover in Box is expected, linking to design documents, dashboards, and any relevant vendor or customer threads.  
- For customer-facing roles, proactively communicate coverage changes to key accounts to avoid surprises.  

## Asset Return and Account Deprovisioning
- All devices, badges, and peripherals must be returned on or before the final day.  
- IT schedules account deprovisioning, preserving records where required for legal and audit purposes.  
- Employees should move working files into the appropriate team Box folder (not personal folders) to ensure continuity.  
- If sensitive data is discovered outside approved systems, Security conducts a remediation review.  

## Final Pay, Benefits, and Obligations
- Final pay is issued on the next regular payroll cycle.  
- Includes any accrued but unused PTO (per local policy).  
- Health coverage continuation options (e.g., COBRA in the U.S.) are communicated within three business days.  
- Employees remain bound by confidentiality and IP assignment agreements after departure.  
- Exit interviews are encouraged; insights often inform improvements to onboarding, tooling, and management practices.  

## Knowledge Transfer Template
A strong knowledge transfer should include:  
1. Summary of each active project and its goals  
2. Open decisions or risks  
3. Links to canonical documents and data sources  
4. Cadence of recurring meetings
