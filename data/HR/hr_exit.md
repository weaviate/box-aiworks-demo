# HR Exit & Offboarding

## Overview
This offboarding guide covers voluntary resignations and involuntary separations. The goals are to maintain business continuity, protect customer and company data, and treat every departing employee with respect. The process is designed to capture critical knowledge, return assets, and provide clear guidance on benefits and final pay.

## Notice and Transition
When an employee provides notice, the manager and HR collaborate on a transition plan. The plan should list open projects, describe the current state of each, and identify who will assume ownership. A short written handover in Box is expected, linking to design documents, dashboards, and relevant vendor or customer threads. For customer-facing roles, managers should proactively communicate coverage changes to key accounts to avoid surprises.

## Asset Return and Account Deprovisioning
All devices, badges, and peripherals must be returned on or before the final day. IT schedules account deprovisioning while preserving records where required for legal and audit purposes. Employees should move working files into the appropriate team Box folder, rather than personal folders, to ensure continuity. If sensitive data is discovered outside approved systems, Security conducts a remediation review.

## Final Pay, Benefits, and Obligations
Final pay is issued on the next regular payroll cycle and includes any accrued but unused PTO, in accordance with local policy. Health coverage continuation options (such as COBRA in the U.S.) are communicated within three business days. Employees remain bound by confidentiality and IP assignment agreements after departure. Exit interviews are encouraged, as the insights often inform improvements to onboarding, tooling, and management practices.

## Knowledge Transfer Template
A strong knowledge transfer should include a summary of each active project and its goals, any open decisions or risks, links to canonical documents and data sources, and the cadence of recurring meetings.
