# HR Onboarding Guide

## Welcome
Welcome to Summit Sports Co.! This guide is designed to give you clarity in your first 90 days so you can build momentum quickly. We sell premium sporting equipment to athletes and retailers worldwide, and every role—whether in HR, Finance, Engineering, or Customer Service—contributes directly to that mission.  

Our culture balances high standards with empathy: we expect strong ownership of outcomes, but we support you with the context, tools, and mentorship you need to be successful.

Your first weeks are about learning our systems, meeting your stakeholders, and shipping something small to build confidence. We operate with a bias for action and seek written clarity: when in doubt, write a short note in Box or Notion outlining what you know, what you’re proposing, and what you need to proceed.

## How We Work
Summit embraces async-first collaboration:  
- Critical decisions are documented in Box with clear owners and due dates.  
- Slack is used for coordination and quick questions.  
- Recurring meetings exist to unblock work, not for status updates.  
- Enterprise search backed by Weaviate makes institutional knowledge discoverable.  

If you can’t find something, assume it exists and search broadly before asking.  
New hires often report that our documented playbooks—particularly for launch readiness, customer escalations, and vendor onboarding—help them contribute quickly.  

## Your First Week
| Day | Focus | Outcome |
|-----|-------|---------|
| Mon | Orientation, accounts, compliance training | All systems access confirmed; security training complete |
| Tue | Meet your manager and cross-functional partners | Understand goals, dependencies, and near-term priorities |
| Wed | Shadow support or sales calls | Hear real customer needs and common pain points |
| Thu | Set up dev or analytics environment | Run the app/report locally; complete a scoped starter task |
| Fri | Draft 30/60/90 plan | Align with your manager on metrics and checkpoints |

## 30/60/90 Day Expectations
- **By Day 30**: Comfortable with core tools, understand roadmap at a high level, deliver a small contribution.  
- **By Day 60**: Own a discrete project and propose one process/document improvement.  
- **By Day 90**: Operate with increasing independence, communicate proactively, mentor the next new hire on at least one topic.  

## Security and Access
- Multi-factor authentication is required on all accounts.  
- Store work only in approved systems: Box (files), Notion (notes), Jira (engineering tasks).  
- If sensitive data is found in a non-approved location, move it and notify Security.  
- Permissions are regularly audited with role-based access controls.  
- Missing access? Open an IT ticket and link the Box folder or Jira board you need.  

## Where to Get Help
- Your **manager** is your first resource for prioritization and context.  
- **HR** can answer questions about benefits, payroll, and policies.  
- **IT** supports devices and account access.  

If something feels off, raise it early—we prefer small course corrections over last-minute heroics.  

We’re excited you’re here; let’s build great things together!
