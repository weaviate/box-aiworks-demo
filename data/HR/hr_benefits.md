# HR Benefits Overview

## Benefits Philosophy
Summitâ€™s benefits are designed to support your health, financial security, and work-life balance. We benchmark annually against companies of similar size and adjust to remain competitive. The information below summarizes our current offerings; official plan documents govern in case of discrepancies.

## Medical, Dental, and Vision

Multiple medical plans are available with varying premiums and deductibles, and preventive care is covered at 100% in-network. Dental coverage includes preventive, basic, and major services, while vision benefits provide annual exams and an allowance for frames or contacts. Summit pays a substantial portion of premiums for employees and also contributes toward dependent coverage.

## Retirement and Financial Wellness

Employees have immediate eligibility for a 401(k) plan with a company match, with contribution options that include pre-tax, Roth, or after-tax (subject to IRS limits). To support financial wellness, Summit also offers quarterly educational webinars and one-on-one sessions with financial counselors.

## Time Away

The company observes major holidays and provides flexible PTO, with guidance to take at least 15 days per year. Paid parental leave is available to all new parents, and additional flexibility is offered to ease the transition back to work. Compassionate leave and jury duty leave are also provided as required.

## Wellness and Professional Development

Employees receive an annual wellness stipend for physical or mental health resources, as well as a development budget for courses, certifications, or conferences aligned with their role. Managers are available to help determine if a resource qualifies.

## Eligibility and Enrollment

Benefits eligibility typically begins on your start date. You must enroll or waive coverage within your initial enrollment window; otherwise, you must wait until the next open enrollment period unless you experience a qualifying life event.
